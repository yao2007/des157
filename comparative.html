        <p>   "Quora a platform to ask questions and connect with people who contribute unique insights and quality answers."" Zhihu is a website which similar with Quora but most of the users are using Chinese.</p>
        <p>   For the interaction design. First,the navigation bar, Zhihu has 8 bottoms and Quora has 6, which means I can spend less time to jump to the page or information that I want to read. Second, the discover bottom in the navigation bar in Zhihu lets users explore knowledge at random. It sounds like time-consuming, but it seems more valuable than wasting time in other social networking platforms. To some extent, this is how zhihu increases user stickiness. Third, the ask question area in quora is quite small, which could make user speaking less and describing question without detail.</p>
        <p>   For the interface design, both site is similar with the structure, but I prefer Zhihu’s since the answers’ blocks are more obviously.</P>
        <p>   Although Zhihu is high similarity with quora in the framework and functions, but they have different growing directions since the different groups of users. IQuora users rarely comment on the questions’ answer. In quora, the number of upvotes under a answer devided by the number of comments under the answers is greater than 20. However, this number in Zhihu is 5 to 10, which means Zhihu users are more likely to comment under the answers. <p>

        <p>   This phenomenon is not intended to emphasize the use of different user groups in different countries have different preferences , but rather to express the different user groups have different effect on the development of the websites. Quora has more social media attributes and less forum attributes, but Zhihu does the opposite. </p>
