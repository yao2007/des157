        <p>   Dyslexia is a specific learning disability in reading. According to the definition given by Wikipedia, dyslexia, also known as reading disorder, is characterized by trouble with reading despite normal intelligence. Problems may include difficulties in spelling words, reading quickly, writing words, "sounding out" words in the head, pronouncing words when reading aloud and understanding what one reads. It affects 3–7% of the population, however, up to 20% may have some degree of symptoms.</p>
        <p>   According to the article <i>Dyslexia in different languages</i> on <i>TIME</i>, the author Tiffany O'Callaghan said,"Dyslexia among English-speakers is generally attributed to the presence of a phonological disorder—or the struggle to separate and keep track of specific, individual sounds."</P>
        <p>   Addtional, the needs of adult dyslexics have been ignored for far too long.</p>
