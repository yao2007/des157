        <p>   Dyslexia is a specific learning disability in reading. According to the definition given by Wikipedia, dyslexia, also known as reading disorder, is characterized by trouble with reading despite normal intelligence. Problems may include difficulties in spelling words, reading quickly, writing words, "sounding out" words in the head, pronouncing words when reading aloud and understanding what one reads. It affects 3–7% of the population, however, up to 20% may have some degree of symptoms.  It has several different diagnosis, which are Central dyslexias, Peripheral dyslexias, and Neglect dyslexia.</p>
        <p>   According to the article <i>Dyslexia in different languages</i> on <i>TIME</i>, the author Tiffany O'Callaghan said,"Dyslexia among English-speakers is generally attributed to the presence of a phonological disorder—or the struggle to separate and keep track of specific, individual sounds."</P>
        <p>   In the book <i>Learning, skill acquisition, reading, and dyslexia. Introduction , the authors found out</i>, “ Much investigation has been devoted to the causes of developmental dyslexia, with the most common finding being deficiencies related to phonological awareness and grapheme-phoneme correspondence. These skills rely on segmenting sound and mapping it to print.” Base on them research, the author Conway and Pisoni point out “much of typical skill learning takes place unintentionally and automatically, but also that the data support stimulus-specific rather than domain-general learning mechanisms in implicit sequence learning.”Based on this chapter in the book, I realized that if we were to add speech/voice during reading, this might help people with dyslexia and could also be used as a training process. </p>
        <p>   More and more people choose to online since the internet spreading. A browser extension that can read the article out loud may be a good helper for them. Actually, this type of browser plug-in is easy to </p>

        <p>find, but its sound is totally inferior to the audio book's quality. On the one hand, I hope that a audio reader with a pleasant voice will come out as time goes on and the development of science and technology. On the other hand, the convenience of reading through electronic reading may improve the reading speed of people with reading disabilities. After all, usually people can only speech 120 to 160 words per minute, but the average adult reads prose text at 250 to 300 words per minute, which are twice of the speaking. The authors of the article, <i>Learners with Dyslexia: Exploring their experiences with different online reading affordances</i>, have the same idea with me. The result of this study is that “the use of screen reader for online reading should be optional, adequate control of screen reader should be provided and screen reader is more beneficial when online text is written in a language that the learner is not proficient.” In essence, I think the cost of e-reading is even lower for people who have dyslexia, because it is quick and easy to adjust the way text are displayed and fonts typed through browser extension. For example, people with dyslexia often reversals the alphabets, at this time a text font with heavy bottom and light top like OpenDyslexic will help them recognize letters correctly.
